## Introduction

Every year the Cronos group organizes the biggest hackathon in Belgium. With the subject this year being "Jungle Expedition", 
the event took place in the center of Antwerp in a conference hall next to the Zoo.

I was invited by Sam Rafie, my peer from Howest, we formed a group and choose the challenge "Blijf uit mijn oerwoud" from the Beehive.
The technology being utilized for the challenge was Java, where we both had experience with.

## Event Overview

After a little road trip to the center of Antwerp, we arrived in the convention center we were treated with some hot coffee and tea. 
Soon after we were guided to the location for our retrospective challenge, and the real work could begin.

We were introduced to the challenge: we would have to protect a "jungle" with different nodes from outliers which were added every few seconds. 
Having to write an algorithm which identifies the most hazardous outliers and remove them. The group which held out for the longest time would of course win the challenge.

We spent most of the morning getting familiar with the code and coming up with a strategy to tackle the problem. 
But before we knew it it was time for the lunch break, were we received plenty of food and drinks. 
We also got the opportunity to quickly visit the Zoo for free, which we used to take some pictures of the koala's.

After lunch we got to work again and started programming our algorithm, doing pair programming to help each other out. 
We made good progress, and created a solution which we were both fairly confident in.

Then it was time for the groups to compete and see who the winner would be. 
Ultimately our hard work payed off as we became second, only being beaten by our fellow Howest students.

After the challenge we were treated with a plentiful menu of food and drinks, during which we got the chance to catch up with some other Howest students and sharing our experiences.
At the end off the day we went home full of confidence with a goody bag, second place price and a certificate.

## Conclusion

I'm very happy to have attended Hack The Future, an experience that was both very fun and instructive. 
I learned not only a lot about Java but also about pair programming and working together.
Which made it a very memorable experience.
