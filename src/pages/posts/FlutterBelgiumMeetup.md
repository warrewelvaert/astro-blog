## Introduction

The Flutter Meetup held at Howest in Bruges, was the 18th edition of the event. 
An interesting event where a bunch of Flutter developers come together to learn and share their experiences with Dart & Flutter.

## Event Overview

The event started with the opportunity for some quick networking, along with some drinks and food from a food truck.

After which the event started with some lightning talks. 
Here developers who wanted could share and show off their Flutter project in quick 5 minute presentation and demonstration. 
The projects included things like, an interactive beer brewery map and integrating crypto currency with Flutter.

After the lightning talks, Thijs Primez from Howest talked about a project he created for a company.
He created a Flutter app which used object detection and optical character recognition, to scan the tubes of silo's and their trucks. 
So truck drivers can smoothly confirm they are using the right silo. 

Although the project was only a proof of concept, I was impressed and learned a lot about object detection. Something I did not have any experience with. 

After this Enzo Conty gave a presentation about accessibility and building an app with support for various disabilities. 
He went over various disabilities which affect users, and what techniques can be used to make applications more accessible for users, and showing the importance of implementing them.

It proved to be an interesting talk which provided me with a bunch of tips to make any web application more accessible.

After the presentation I enrolled in a raffle with tickets to FlutterCon as the grand prize. 
Sadly I did not win anything.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the Flutter Meetup was an interesting and informative event. Although I had worked with Flutter before, my knowledge of it was limited so I learned a lot about the Dart & Flutter. 

Beyond that I also learned a lot about object detection and accessibility, and would recommend the Flutter Meetup for any Flutter enthusiasts.
